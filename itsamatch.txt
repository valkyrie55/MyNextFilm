IT’S A MATCH!

EXT. MALL -EVENING


It’s a Saturday evening. The area around the mall is too
crowded. We see two guys coming out of the mall near the
corrider. One guy, Akash(35) is wearing shorts and a tshirt
with branded shoes carrying his gym bag and a sipper. Other
guy, Kush(38) is wearing joggers with tshirt carrying a gym
bag and a phone on the other hand. Their car "Mercedez S
class" arrives. As soon as they sit in the car Kush’s phone
buzzez.


INT. CAR. -EVENING

He gets a notification saying "Its a match". He
unlocks his phone and gets excited by seeing the
notification. He opens the profile, he matched with Pooja.
There is a side picture of a woman with open straight hair
and wearing big jhumkas. Kush’s not able to see the full
face but just the side angle. He clicks on the profile to
read the bio. The bio reads,

"It doesn’t even matter whatever i write down here but still
you’re gonna swipe based on the pictures but still I am
writing.I am Delhite/Punjabi/Gemini/Doglover, I am 5’7,
Married in Delhi,fun-loving person who likes to live on her
own conditions, IF YOU’RE LOOKING FOR A HOOKE UP THEN SWIPE
RIGHT BECAUSE I AM ONLY LOOKING FOR A CASUAL
RELATIONSHIP,with a smart, decent and a mature person also
can’t tolerate grammar mistakes. And, the most important
thing, No strings attached"

Kush gets more excited looking at the bio. Meanwhile, Akash
calls his girlfriend on the phone.

Kush sees the bio and
immediately sends Pooja "HI". 

He waits for few seconds and
gets a reply saying "Hey".

Their conversation starts..

KUSH
"Read your bio, saying no strings
attached, I like that you are being
honest. By the way, I also married,
blessed with son. He is 8 years
old"

POOJA
"omg, you dont look like someone
with an 8 year old kid. Are you a
gym freak?"

KUSH
"yes, i am very much into fitness.
very active"

POOJA
"i really like people who look
after themselves"

KUSH
I am too fit, too active.
Haha. ;)

POOJA

KUSH

And, I am also blessed with a
daughter. She is 7 years old.

POOJA
Jhoote! You can hardly see my face
in the picture.

KUSH

side profile, with your perfect
jawline and pretty jhumkas. I like
tall girls and you’re 5’7. ;)

POOJA

KUSH

Kush takes two seconds to reply.

KUSH
So, Pooja, when can we meet?

POOJA
Listen, my husband is coming

KUSH
He is coming tomorrow na, not

POOJA

Akash ask Kush "nariyal paani piyega? Kush just nods and
doesn’t say anything. Akash ask the driver to stop the car
near the stall.

EXT. STALL. -EVENING.

They go outside for nariyal paani. Kush is
very much into the conversation with Pooja and doesn’t give
much attention to Akash. As they take one sip of naariyal
paani and Jay gets another notification.

POOJA
I am only free from 7 to 11pm
tonight.

KUSH
Oh, that’s perfect. Where are we
meeting?

POOJA

KUSH
Great, I’ll reach there in 15
minutes.

POOJA
Don’t come in your car. Come in
uber. Its nearby my place, I will

KUSH
Okay, let me book Uber then

Kush immediately books a cab and tell Akash that he needs to
go somewhere urgently. Akash is confused. But Kush convinces
him that he has something very important and will tell him
everything later.

Kush uber arrives and he messages Pooja.

KUSH
My cab is here. I will reach there
in 15 minutes.

POOJA

Kush is getting impatient. He ask the driver.

KUSH

KUSH
Thoda jaldi chalao na!

DRIVER

Kush phone buzzez. Pooja has messaged that she has reached.

KUSH
just 2 more minutes..

EXT/INT. HOSPITAL. -EVENING

Kush reaches there. He pays the driver in a hurry and runs
towards the hospital.
We see patients everywhere. There is silence and sadness in
the hospital. Jay is in a hurry. He reaches in the cafe.

INT. HOSPITAL CAFE. -EVENING

There is a little silence. Monotonous, we can see people
stressed out. Medicines on the right table. Some old woman
in crying sitting in a cafe.

Kush is looking around here and there and he sees a
reflection of a woman from the glass door sitting on a side
table. She is in yellow dress, straight hair. She flips her
hair behind her ear, Kush sees her wearing the same jhumkas.
Kush approaches her. He says ’Hi’. Pooja turns around and we
see a beautiful woman. Kush is in a awe looking at her. She
is 5’7.

POOJA
(as she stands to shake hands)
Kush?

KUSH
Kushagra Mehta

POOJA
You look better than your
pictures.

KUSH
Thankyou! You ARE 5’7

POOJA
Yeah and with heels 5’9. And,
you’re 6’?

KUSH

They chuckle and give a sid hug to each other and then sit.

POOJA
Coffee?

KUSH
Yeah, I’ll just order.

POOJA
I already did. Americano without
sugar?

KUSH
How do you know?

POOJA
I know what fit people drink.
Their coffee arrives. Kush gets more excited and gets
attracted to her. Kush takes a pause.

KUSH
(pointing at the cafe)
Why this place? 

POOJA
Male dominated society haina yaar!
Aap log toh kisise kahin bhi mil
sakte hai. Ladkiyon ke saath aisa
nahi hai. Hume toh sab kuch sochna
sambhajhna hota hai, and as you
know I am married. Toh mujhe lagta
yeh ek aisi jagah jaha kisi ka bhi
uss taraf mind nahi jayega. Yaha
kisine dekh liya toh I can say I am
here to see a friend. No one would
doubt me.

KUSH
You are so smart. So intelligent.
Tumhari beauty ke saath na mein
tumhare intelligence ka bhi fan ho
gaya hu.

Kush sips drinks very proudly.

KUSH
(Getting very excited)
I seriously dont belive tumhari
jaisi ladkiya bhi hoti hai.
Seriously, I mean? Meri biwi bhi
aisi nahi hai yaar!

POOJA
Uh..

KUSH
You’re definitely a girlfriend
material.

POOJA
Wahi toh nahi karna. I told you na,
no strings attached.

KUSH
(takes a pause)
So, what’s
next?

POOJA
(ask in a flirty way)
you tell me na, you’re the man.

KUSH
give me a suggestion, i’ll go with
your comfort.

POOJA
uh..Imperial? Presidential Suit?

KUSH
(Gets excited)
That’s perfect!

POOJA
okay, let me check the price.

Pooja starts checking the prices on the phone. She is
calculating everything on the phone while looking at prices.

POOJA
(while looking at the phone,whispering)
Okay, 75,000 for presidential suit plus taxes, then we will order from Spice Route with nice wine and tip?
4000? 

KUSH
make it 5.

POOJA
okay so, total cost one lakh five
thousand rupees.

KUSH
But why are you doing this? I will
lookmafter everything ya!

POOJA
(saying it by raising eyebrows)
Listen, Don’t make wrong but I dont
want any kind of favours from you
or anyone from this world. Aur
waise bhi jab ladke bill pay karte
haina toh kahin na kahin woh
ladkiyon ki azadi kharidte
hai.

Kush is all surprised, his eyes gets wide open. He takes a
deep breath

KUSH
Tumahare per chulu mein? Aisi
ladkiyan hoti hai?

POOJA
Kyun? Tumhari biwi aisi nahi hai?

KUSH
(his mood changes saying this)
Let’s not go there. 

POOJA
(changing the topic)
so, shall
I book the cab?

KUSH

Pooja then brings out her phone to book an Ola.

POOJA
Our cab is 2 minutes away. So,
let’s go out.

and covers her head with the dupatta. Kush is just looking
at her. He can see the jhumkas from her dupatta. They are
going towards the cab in a hurry.
Their ola is waiting outside.

Pooja gives the OTP to the driver as they sit in the car.
They are in the car and Kush is getting impatient. He slides
his hand towards her thigh. Pooja stops him.

POOJA
Wait na! We are going there.

Kush then comes closer to Pooja.

POOJA
We’ll order wine. And sushi. You
like sushi na?

Kush is just looking at her with awe

KUSH
You have so much knowledge about
food na! Pata hai, mein apne ghar
pe chicken bhi nahi kha sakta.

POOJA
(with a shocking face)
kyun? Are you a vegeterian? 

KUSH

POOJA
(in a seductive way)
Don’t worry, mere saath kha sakte
